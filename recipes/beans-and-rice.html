  <h2>Description:</h2>
  <p>Classic Cuban-style beans and rice. This recipe is easy, cheap, and delicious to make. There is a reason why this is a staple food all over the world.</p>
  <p>I will be using an instant pot for this recipe, but you can use a pressure cooker or regular pot to prepare the beans. Just note that you will have to adjust cooking times and techniques accordingly.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>16 oz bag of black beans (other beans are fine too)</li>
    <li>1 cup dry rice (can really be any amount you're going to eat)</li>
    <li>3-5 slices bacon, a ham hock, 1.5 lb chicken breast... Some protein if you want it.</li>
    <li>1 onion, chunked</li>
    <li>3-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 can diced tomatoes with chiles (optional)</li>
    <li>1-2 bay leaves</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oregano</li>
    <li>2 tbsp cumin</li>
    <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>3 oz orange juice</li>
    <li>1 oz lemon or lime juice</li>
    <li>8 cups chicken stock or water (I use better than bullion)</li>
    <li>1 fresh tomato, diced (for garnish, optional)</li>
    <li>1 avocado, diced (for garnish, optional)</li>
    <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish, optional)</li>
    <li>Shredded cheese (for garnish, optional)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>(OPTIONAL): Soak your beans overnight in some lightly-salted water. You can add baking soda as well to reduce potential gassiness.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>You can also quick-soak in an instant pot by putting beans in with just enough water to cover and pressure cooking on high for about 5 minutes.</li>
    </ul>
    <li>Saute your onions and garlic until they are soft and fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add beans, stock, orange juice, lime juice, and spices. Add the can of tomato here if you have it.</li>
    <li>Pressure cook for 60 minutes on high pressure. Make sure the beans are tender, because they will take much longer than anything else to cook.</li>
    <li>Prepare your rice while the beans cook. You can do this on the stovetop or use a rice cooker. </li>
    <li>Once everything is finished cooking, spoon out a serving of rice and put the beans on top. Add garnishes now (they really take this to the next level).</li>
    <li>Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
  </ol>
