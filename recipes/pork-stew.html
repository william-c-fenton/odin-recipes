  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Toss onion powder, parsley, 1 tbsp garlic powder, seasoned salt, 1.5 tbsp black pepper, marjoram, cinnamon, and nutmeg in a large plastic bag. Add the cubed pork, toss until coated, then seal and refrigerate overnight.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 250 degrees, line a 9x9 in baking dish with half of the spinach</li>
    <li>Pack the marinated pork into the dish and cover with the remaining spinach leaves. Cover the pan with foil and bake for 3 hours, or until tender.</li>
